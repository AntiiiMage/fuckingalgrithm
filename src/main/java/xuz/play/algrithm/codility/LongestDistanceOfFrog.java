// There are N blocks, numberred from 0 to N-1 , arranged in a row , A couple of frogs were sitting
// together on one block when they had a terrible quarrel. Now they want to jump away from one another so
// that the distance between them will be as large as possible. The distance between blocks numbberd J
// and K, where J<=k, is cmputed as K-J+1, The frog can only jump up, meaning that they can move from
// one block to another only if two blocks are adjaccent and the second block is of the same or greater
// height as the first What is the longest distance that thay can possibly create between each other, if
// they also chose to sit on the optimal startging block initially?

//    You need to find the longest decreasing then increasing subseqence (using consecutive terms) in the sequence

/*  Example 1:
    given blocks = [2,6,8,5] -> return 3,
    if starting from blocks[0], the first frog can stay where it is and the second frog can jump to blocks[2](but not blocks[3])

    Example 2:
    blocks = [1,5,5,2,6], return 4;
    if starting from blocks[3] the first frog can jump to blocks[1], but not blocks[0] and the second frog can jump to blocks[4]

    Example 3:
    Blocks[1,1] return 2
    If starting from blocks[1] , the first frog can jump to blocks[0] and the second frog cn stay where it it, Starting from blocks[0] would result in the same distance.
